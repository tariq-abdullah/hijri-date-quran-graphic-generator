Feel free to modify it and use it for your own projects if its is useful, only expectation from you then will be some dua for me and the whole ummah.

This project was made for my self use as I used to create these graphics manually for my friends and shared them. However it became tedious to match everyday's correct timing resulting in mistakes. 


This little app uses Quran.cloud api to fetch timings. 

The list of cities supported is very small however you can make a pull request after integrating your own city. The file for list of cities is included in this repo.
